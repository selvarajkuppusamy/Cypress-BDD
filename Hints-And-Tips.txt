Issues Faced - 

1. Set up with BDD was not straight forward
    Changes in cypress.config.ts file took some time to understand, explained steps in Set up BDD above.

2. Changes made in Feature file and Step files were not picked by the Cypress app.
    - only 2 tests were running when 3 scenarios are written in feature file
    - had to clear cookies for cypress app to resolve this.
